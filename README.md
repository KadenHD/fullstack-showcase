# Fullstack Showcase

This repository is a full-stack showcase project designed to demonstrate real-world application architecture and integrations.

It includes a backend API and a frontend client, covering common patterns and tools used in modern production systems, such as:

- Authentication & authorization
- Payments and billing
- Relational and non-relational databases
- API design
- Frontend client consuming the API
- Environment configuration and security best practices

The goal of this project is not to build a single product, but to serve as a technical playground and reference for full-stack development.
